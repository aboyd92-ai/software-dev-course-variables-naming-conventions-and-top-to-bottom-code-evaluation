let a = "Alice";
let items = 5;
let item = "sweaters";
let item price = 20;
let d = a + " bought " + b + " items for $" + c + ".";

console.log(d);

// Refactored Code
let customerName = "Alice";
let numberOfItems = 5;
let itemName = "sweaters";
let itemPrice = 20;
let totalCost = numberOfItems * itemPrice;
let receipt = customerName + " bought " + numberOfItems + " " + itemName + " for $" + totalCost + ".";
console.log(receipt);

to answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of each variable in the refactored code?
   - `customerName`: Stores the name of the customer. in this case, "Alice".
   - `numberOfItems`: Stores the quantity of items purchased. which is 5.
   - `itemName`: Stores the name of the item being purchased. in this case, "sweaters".
   - `itemPrice`: Stores the price of a single item. in this case, 20.
   - `totalCost`: Stores the total cost of the items purchased (calculated as `numberOfItems * itemPrice`). in this case, $100.
   - `receipt`: Stores the final receipt message to be displayed.

2. How does the refactored code improve readability and maintainability?
   - The refactored code uses descriptive variable names, making it easier to understand the purpose of each variable at a glance.
   - By breaking down the calculations into separate variables, the code becomes more modular and easier to modify in the future.

3. What are the benefits of using descriptive variable names?
   - Descriptive variable names improve code readability, allowing developers to quickly grasp the purpose of each variable.
   - They help prevent errors by making it clear what data is being manipulated.
   - Descriptive names make the code easier to maintain and update, as the intent is clear.
